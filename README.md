# osu-skin-KaKKeY
KaKKeY is a STD osu!lazer skin originated by fuyukiS' uncompleted rhythm game project KaKKeY.

Hitsounds and `followpoint*` are from [`Moonshine 2.1`](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1610388?n=1) by [`moonstaar`](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27339355), default cursor and `cursor-Selyui` in extras are from [`Selyui 1.2`](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1629078?n=1) by [`alivemaster` aka `sb233asdf`](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10324621), everything else are drawn by fuyukiS with Inkscape.

The sources SVG files are not ready yet, so this repo is basically empty. Check out Releases for download.
