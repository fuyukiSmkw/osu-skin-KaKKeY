# osu-skin-KaKKeY
KaKKeY is a STD osu!lazer skin originated by fuyukiS' uncompleted rhythm game project KaKKeY.

Hitsounds and `followpoint*` are from [`Moonshine 2.1`](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1610388?n=1) by [`moonstaar`](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/27339355), default cursor and `cursor-Selyui` in extras are from [`Selyui 1.2`](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1629078?n=1) by [`alivemaster` aka `sb233asdf`](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/10324621), everything else are drawn by fuyukiS with Inkscape.

The sources SVG files are not ready yet, so this repo is basically empty. Check out Releases for download.

## Screenshots
Only the first screenshot is the current version (2024.06.01), which has updated combo colors, cursor and UI.

The old combo colors, cursor and UI (as you can see in the rest screenshots) can be found in `Extras/*-classic`.
